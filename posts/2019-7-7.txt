  I went to \"Yoshiya Purely Hand Cut Udon\" on Sunday. I ordered the "Large bukkake udon with par-boiled egg" and Chicken Tempura.

  As usual both chopped spring onion and fresh minced ginger were available to put on the udon after I recieved my order at the counter. It would have been nice to have them available where I was eating so that I could top up as I ate instead of stocking up at the beginning.

  The chicken went very well with the Udon. I dipped the chicken in the soup and the mixture of runny yolk and salty broth was very nice

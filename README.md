# Udon Blog

A blog collecting my experiences eating udon in Japan.

This is also my first foray into project pages (as part of [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/)).

## Plan

Create an interpreter for text files that will be formatted in such a way that I can easily create new blog posts and automatically add them to the project page.

- [ ] Write some posts.
  - [x] Write the first post.
- [ ] Make the skeleton for the website.
  - [ ] Learn HTML.
  - [ ] Learn CSS.
  - [ ] Learn JavaScript.
- [x] Eat some udon.
- [ ] Eat more udon.
- [ ] 日本語のサイトも作ること。

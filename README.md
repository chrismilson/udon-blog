# Udon Blog

A blog collecting my experiences eating udon in Japan.

This is also my first foray into project pages (as part of [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/)).

## Plan

Create an interpreter for text files that will be formatted in such a way that I can easily create new blog posts and automatically add them to the project page.

* [ ] Write some posts.
* [ ] Make the skeleton for the website.
* [x] Eat some udon.
* [ ] Eat more udon.

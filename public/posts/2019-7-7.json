      "I went to \"Yoshiya Purely Hand Cut Udon\" on Sunday. I ordered the \"Large bukkake udon with par-boiled egg\" and Chicken Tempura.",
      "As usual both chopped spring onion and fresh minced ginger were available to put on the udon after I recieved my order at the counter. It would have been nice to have them available where I was eating so that I could top up as I ate instead of stocking up at the beginning.",

      "The chicken went very well with the Udon. I dipped the chicken in the soup and the mixture of runny yolk and salty broth was very nice"

      "美味しかったです。麺の硬さが完璧だったと思います。本当に手打ちなので大きさはバラバラだけど、それがいいところだと思います",
      "悪いことは特にないですが、ねぎとしょうがはレジでしかなかったから、ちょっと困りました。最初にいっぱい載せないといけませんでした。",
